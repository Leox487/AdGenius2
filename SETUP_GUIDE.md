# Quick Setup Guide

## To get the AdGenius app working with real ad data:

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a file called `.env.local` in your project root with these contents:

```env
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production

# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"

# Optional: Third-party API Keys for Real Ad Discovery
# Get these from their respective platforms for real ad data

# Google Custom Search API (for Google Ads discovery)
GOOGLE_ADS_API_KEY=your-google-custom-search-api-key
GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ID=your-custom-search-engine-id

# Facebook Marketing API (for Facebook Ads discovery)
FACEBOOK_MARKETING_API_KEY=your-facebook-marketing-api-key

# SEMrush API (for competitor analysis)
SEMRUSH_API_KEY=your-semrush-api-key

# SpyFu API (for ad intelligence)
SPYFU_API_KEY=your-spyfu-api-key
```

### 2. Restart the Development Server
After creating the `.env.local` file, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## What You'll See

The enhanced system now shows:
- âœ… **Real ad examples** for your specific product
- âœ… **Actual performance metrics** (CTR, conversions, cost per click)
- âœ… **Detailed analysis** explaining why each ad was successful
- âœ… **Key success factors** and platform-specific tips
- âœ… **Relevance scores** showing how well each ad matches your product
- âœ… **Links to real ad examples** when available

## Example Output

When you search for "hats", you'll see ads like:
- "Premium Baseball Caps - 50% Off" (CTR: 6.8%, Conv: 5.2%)
- "Custom Embroidered Hats" (CTR: 4.2%, Conv: 3.8%)
